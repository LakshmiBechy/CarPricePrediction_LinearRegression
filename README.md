# CarPricePrediction using LinearRegression
## Problem Description
A Chinese automobile company aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts. They have contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market. Essentially, the company wants to know: • Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car • How well those variables describe the price of a car Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars across the American market.

### Business Goal
You are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for the management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

### Building a Linear Regression Model for Price Prediction: Steps

1. Data Exploration: The initial step involved exploring the dataset, understanding its structure, and identifying the available features. This included examining 
   the shape of the dataset, gaining insights into each column, reviewing summary statistics, and identifying unique values of each of the variables.

2. Basic Data Cleaning: The dataset was checked for null values, duplicate rows, and any other data quality issues. Cleaning the data ensured that the subsequent 
   analysis and modeling stages are based on reliable and accurate information.

3. Data Analysis: A thorough analysis of the distribution of categorical and numerical features was conducted. The correlation heatmap was used to identify 
   relationships between numerical features. Additionally, how each independent feature influenced the target variable (car price) was also analyzed.

4. Data Encoding: To prepare the categorical features for modeling, label encoding and one-hot encoding techniques were employed. This step ensured that the 
   categorical data could be effectively used by the linear regression model.

5. Data Splitting: The dataset was split into predictor variables and the target variable (car prices). A test-train split was also performed, allowing us to train 
   the model on one subset of the data and test its performance on another.

6. Feature Scaling: Numerical features were scaled to bring them to a similar scale, which is often necessary for linear regression. This step improved the model's 
   stability and convergence.

7. Hyperparameter Tuning and Feature Selection: Grid Search Cross-Validation was employed to tune hyperparameters and select the best model configuration, to 
   ensure model's performance and generalization ability.

8. Making Predictions: Utilizing the best-configured model, predictions were made on the test dataset. 
 
9. Model Evaluation and Sample Prediction : The final step involved evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics. As a demonstration of the model's 
   practical application, an example prediction was made where the model estimated the price of a car based on its attributes.
